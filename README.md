PbN is a digital paint by number app where users can upload their favorite image, have it converted to a convenient paint by numbers outline, and apply paint to each area.  Users are able to utilize a handy key so that they know which area holds which color.  Once images are created, users can upload their masterpiece to a global gallery or share their digital artpiece via social media.

PbN was created by an artist/web developer, Erin Mahoney, who coincidentally cannot draw or paint!  You can find out more of this artist/web developer by checking out her [portfolio](http://erinmahoneydev.com/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/@ErinTheRad).
